# lovebomb-game, in progress

Silly little visual novel, created with Shannon, Li, and Cameron. To link further on. 

Currently developing the text visual novel engine. I want to make a more modular system for any game that needs vsual novel components. 

This is a repository solely for code, not any other unity files or assets.
